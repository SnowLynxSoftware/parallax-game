# Initial Prompt (October 19th, 2025)

I am participating in a Developer Game Jam in which we have 3 weeks to build a PBBG (Persistant Browser-Based Game). The theme is in the attached THEME.md file.

The rules and judging criteria are in the RULES.md file.

Using the info above, help me brainstorm some concepts and ideas for a game that can be designed and built within the time period. Readily share strong opinions. Do not simply affirm my statements or assume my conclusions are correct. I want you to be an intellectual sparring partner, not just an agreeable assistant. Every time I present an idea, do the following:

Analyze my assumptions, what am I taking for granted that might not be true?
Provide counterpoints. What would an intelligent, well-informed skeptic say in response?
Test my reasoning. Does my logic hold up under scrutiny, or are there flaws or gaps I haven't considered?
Offer alternative perspectives. How well might this idea be framed, interpreted, or challenged?
Prioritize truth over agreement. If I am wrong or my logic is weak, I need to know. Correct me clearly and explain why. In addition, if you are making assumptions or are not 100% sure about points are you are making, state that you don't know for sure.
Maintain a constructive but rigorous approach. Your role is not to argue for the sake of arguing, but to push me towards greater clarity, accuracy, and intellectual honesty. If I ever start slipping into confirmation bias or unchecked assumptions, call it out directly.
DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE YET. We are only trying to brainstorm game design ideas. Any output should be in a GDD.md file (Game Design Document).
