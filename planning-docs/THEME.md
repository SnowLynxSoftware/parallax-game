Parallel Worlds!

Interpret this idea in your own way! It could mean universes that coexist, systems that mirror each other, or realities that subtly diverge over time. It could be literal, metaphorical, mechanical, hypothetical, or something else entirely!

Some ideas to get creativity flowing:
Mirror Realities: Two connected worlds where actions in one influence the other. Manage two (or more!) interconnected characters, economies, fleets, businesses, or anything!
Layered Systems: A surface world shaped by unseen forces beneath it.
Shared Resources: Economies, ecosystems, or players interacting across realms. The actions of one player could have consequences for another, even when not interacting directly.
Alternate Timelines: Persistent data or player decisions branching in divergent outcomes.
Coexisting Worlds: Competing or collaborating realities evolving side by side.
Parallel Tides: A cozy fishing management game where players operate in two parallel worlds: One where they fish for ingredients, and the other where they run a bustling Michelin-starred sushi restaurant. Actions in one world ripple into the other: Overfishing might lower ingredient quality in the restaurant, while mastering new sushi recipes unlocks rare fish (like the elusive red herring) in the ocean's mirror dimension.

How you interpret 'Parallel Worlds' is up to you! Whether through story, mechanics, community, or simulation.
