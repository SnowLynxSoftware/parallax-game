          <li>
            <strong>Password:</strong> Securely hashed using industry-standard

          <li>
            <strong>Payment Information:</strong> For Pro account subscriptions,

          <li>
            <strong>Link Analytics Data:</strong> For all shortened links (both
            registered and guest users), we collect and analyze detailed click
            event data including: IP-derived country information (via
            third-party service ip-api.com), browser type and version, device
            type (desktop/mobile/bot), raw user agent strings, referrer URLs,
            bot detection flags, and timestamp of each click. This data is
            stored individually for each redirect to provide comprehensive
            analytics while maintaining an aggregate click counter for quick
            access.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IP Addresses:</strong> We collect IP addresses for security
            purposes, fraud prevention, and to derive geographic location
            (country) for analytics. IP addresses are sent to ip-api.com, a free
            third-party geolocation service, to determine the country of origin.
            If this service is unavailable or rate-limited, geographic data will
            be recorded as unknown. We do not store raw IP addresses in our

          We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to
          provide the Service, comply with our legal obligations, resolve
          disputes, and enforce our agreements. The specific retention periods
          vary depending on the type of information and the purposes for which
          it is used.
        </p>

        <p class="text-secondary"><strong>Retention Periods:</strong></p>
        <ul class="text-secondary">
          <li>
            <strong>Active Accounts:</strong> We retain your account
            information, link data, and analytics for as long as your account
            remains active and in good standing
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Guest User Links:</strong> Links created by Guest Users
            (without an account) automatically expire and are permanently
            deleted 7 days after creation. Click event analytics data (country,
            browser, device, user agent, referrer, bot detection) is collected
            for these links and retained until the link expires and is deleted.
            No personally identifiable information is collected from guests
            creating links.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soft-Deleted Data:</strong> When you delete your account or
            request deletion of your data, we perform a "soft delete" that
            removes the data from active use but retains it in our backup
            systems. Soft-deleted data is retained for up to 1 year before
            permanent deletion. During this retention period, soft-deleted data
            may be restored by our support team if necessary (for example, if
            you accidentally deleted your account)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Link Analytics:</strong> Click event analytics data for your
            shortened links (including country, browser, device, user agent,
            referrer, and bot detection) is retained while your account is
            active or until you request its deletion. Once your account is
            permanently deleted, all associated analytics data (both aggregate
            counts and individual click events) is also permanently deleted
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication Records:</strong> We may retain records of
            communications with you (such as support tickets and email
            correspondence) for as long as necessary to provide support and
            maintain records of our communications
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal and Compliance Purposes:</strong> We may retain
            certain information for longer periods if required by law,
            regulation, legal process, or to establish, exercise, or defend
            legal claims. This may include retaining information related to
            payment transactions, account security incidents, or Terms of
            Service violations
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-secondary">
          After the applicable retention period expires, we will permanently
          delete or anonymize your personal information in a secure manner that
